The goal of this project was to run a simulation of a drone flying through a series of rings and to minimize run time and maximize success rate. To do this, and LQR state feedback controller was implemented as well as full state-feedback reference tracking. 
Our LQR weights were tuned to optimize time of completion and success rate. These metrics as well as root mean squared error valules can be viewed in the corresponding files.
