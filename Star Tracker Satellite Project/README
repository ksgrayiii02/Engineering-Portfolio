The goal of this project was to run a simulated satellite and to design a reaction wheel configuration and LQR state-feedback controller using a state estimate provided by a star tracker and to use this estimate to orient the spacecraft towards the center of the star cluster that was being tacked.
Additionally, a requirement was to tune the LQR gains such that the spacecraft stays at equilibrium for as long as possible before sensor noise causes too large of an error for the system to handle.
The simulation was ran 100 times and relevent error data and run time histograms are in the corresponding files.
