This file shows a table of root-mean-square error values for different types of flight. The details of them are as follows:
The first set of values is a test flight using the controller and observer that we designed as well as the built-in Kalman Filter.
The second set of values is a test flight using the controller, observer, and Kalman filter that we designed.
The third set of values is a test flight using the built-in controller and observer as well as the Kalman Filter we designed.

The greatest performance was seen when running our Kalman filter with the default controller and observer and this is likely due to a variety of additional functions built into the default controller/observer that we did not have access to during our design.
In addition, there were some functions in the built-in Kalman filter that were not able to be utilized in our Kalman filter design for the same reason.
